# Architecture Decision Records (ARDs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records for the project. Each ARD documents a significant technical or structural decision — what was decided, why, what was ruled out, and what the consequences are.

ARDs are written when a decision is made and updated if circumstances change. They are not deleted — superseded decisions are marked as such and kept for historical context.

## What belongs here

- Technology choices (language, framework, database, external APIs)
- Structural patterns (adapter pattern, repository pattern, module boundaries)
- Constraint decisions (no scraping, BYOK model, CLI-only scope)
- Anything where future-you (or a new collaborator) would ask "why did we do it this way?"

## What does not belong here

- Implementation details (those go in docs/specs/)
- Project timelines or milestones (those go in docs/plans/)
- Runbooks or procedures (those go in docs/SOPs/)

## Naming convention

`ARD-NNN-short-description.md` — e.g. `ARD-001-database-choice.md`
