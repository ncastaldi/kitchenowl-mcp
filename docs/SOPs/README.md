# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

This folder contains SOPs and runbooks for repeatable tasks — procedures that need to be followed consistently, whether by a developer, an operator, or an LLM assistant.

SOPs are written for execution, not reading. Each one should be specific enough that someone unfamiliar with the project can follow it without guesswork.

## What belongs here

- Environment setup and onboarding procedures
- Deployment and release procedures
- Database migration runbooks
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Any task that is repeated and must be done the same way each time

## What does not belong here

- One-off scripts (those go in scripts/)
- Architecture decisions behind the procedures (those go in docs/ARDs/)
- High-level plans or roadmaps (those go in docs/plans/)

## Naming convention

`SOP-short-description.md` — e.g. `SOP-local-environment-setup.md`, `SOP-deploy-to-production.md`

## Recommended SOP structure

Each SOP should include:
- **Purpose** — what this procedure accomplishes
- **When to use it** — trigger conditions
- **Prerequisites** — what must be true before starting
- **Steps** — numbered, atomic, verifiable
- **Verification** — how to confirm it worked
- **Rollback** — how to undo it if something goes wrong
- **Escalation** — what to do if the SOP fails
